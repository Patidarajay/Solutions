11)  Which characters may be used as the second character of     an identifier,but not as the first character of an     identifier?
    - Identifier should always state with alphabets and numbers can be anywhere after that. 
    
12 a ) 10 * 20 will become int
   b) Cannot increment final variable


16) a) Remainder is zero as i++ will execute after statement ends
    b) Remainder is 1 as ++i will execute before statement ends
 
17) if i is int 
    i > 0 --> boolean -- conditional check
    i = 0 --> int -- assignment
    i++ --> int -- increment
    float(i) -- float -- casting 
    i == 0 -- boolean --> conditional check
    "aString" + i --> String 
    
 18) false 
 
 19) i = 1 is assingment and if is conditional operator

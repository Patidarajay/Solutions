11. Which characters may be used as the second character of
an identifier,but not as the first character of an identifier?

Answer: The digits 0 through 9 may not be used as the first character of an identifier 
but they maybe used after the first character of an identifier.


12. Correct the following code.
i ) class Casting{
public static void main(String[] args){
byte a=10;
byte b=20;
byte c=a*b;
System.out.println(c);
}
}

Error: Type mismatch: cannot convert from into to byte.
Solution: So we have to do widening or Automatic conversion as shown below:
int c = a*b;


ii) class CheckCode{
public static void main(String[] args){
final int SIZE=10;
for(int i=0;i<SIZE;i++){
System.out.println(i);
}
SIZE=20;
for(int j=SIZE;j>0;j--){
System.out.println(j);
}
}
}

Error: The final local variable SIZE cannot be assigned.
solution: A final variable can be initialized only once, either via an initializer or an assignment statement. 
          So SIZE=20 cannot be asigned, if SIZE variable mentioned as final.
Note: It is considered good practice to represent final constants in all uppercase, using underscore to separate words.


16).Consider the following code snippet:
int i = 10;
int n = i++%5;
What are the values of i and n after the code is executed?
Solution: The postfix form first returns the current value of the expression and then performs the increment operation on that value.
Output  : i= 11 and n = 0

What are the final values of i and n if instead of using the postfix increment operator (i++), you use the
prefix version (++i))?
Solution: The prefix form first performs the increment operation and then returns the value of the increment operation.
Output  : i= 11 and n = 1
